# Project Context

This is a business investment platform that connects:

- **Creators** (entrepreneurs with business ideas)
- **Investors** (looking to fund opportunities)

The platform has a sophisticated matching system that pairs users based on compatibility factors like amount, industry alignment, stage preference, and risk tolerance.

## Messages Page Relevance

The messages page is essential because:

### Natural Extension of Matches
The matches page shows action buttons like "Start Conversation" and "Continue Discussion" that would naturally lead users to the messages page.

### Business Communication
Investment deals require ongoing communication about:
- Business ideas and valuations
- Pitch decks and financial projections
- Negotiation terms
- Due diligence questions

### User Flow Integration
The messages page includes a "View Match" button that links back to the matches page, showing clear integration with the matching system.
