## Technical Stack Implementation Details

### Frontend Implementation (Next.js + Tailwind + Shadcn)
```bash
# Project initialization
npx create-next-app@latest business-matchmaking --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
cd business-matchmaking
npx shadcn-ui@latest init

# Key dependencies to install
npm install convex zod react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers lucide-react
npm install @coinbase/commerce (or stripe for crypto payments)
```

### Backend Implementation (Convex)
```typescript
// Core Convex setup
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const createUser = mutation({
  args: {
    email: v.string(),
    name: v.string(),
    userType: v.union(v.literal("creator"), v.literal("investor")),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // User creation logic
  },
});
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Matching Algorithm Performance**
   - Start with simplified scoring for quick implementation
   - Implement caching for expensive calculations
   - Add performance monitoring and alerting

2. **Payment Integration Complexity**
   - Choose established, well-documented payment providers
   - Implement comprehensive error handling and rollback mechanisms
   - Start with testnet/sandbox environments

3. **Real-time Feature Scalability**
   - Use Convex's built-in real-time capabilities
   - Implement proper indexing for database queries
   - Add rate limiting for real-time updates

### Business Risks
1. **Market Validation**
   - Focus on core matching as primary differentiator
   - Implement feedback systems to iterate quickly
   - Plan for pivots based on user behavior

2. **User Acquisition**
   - Build comprehensive onboarding flow
   - Implement referral system for organic growth
   - Create clear value proposition for both user types

## Next Steps After Planning

1. **Finalize Technical Stack**: Choose specific versions and payment providers
2. **Set Up Development Environment**: Initialize project and configure tools
3. **Begin Implementation**: Start with Phase 1 foundation work
4. **Regular Reviews**: Weekly check-ins to assess progress and adjust plans
5. **User Feedback Integration**: Plan for early user testing and iteration

This roadmap provides a structured approach to building your business idea-investment matchmaking platform while maintaining flexibility to adapt based on technical challenges and market feedback.
